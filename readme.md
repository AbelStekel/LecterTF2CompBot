Small readme for the discord bot.
tf2compbot (or, tf_lecterbot)

Made by: Lecter, tf_lecter (steam, youtube) or twitch.tv/DrLector

This is a Discord bot written in Python.

Goal of the bot is to use both the steam and etf2l APIs to easily check the division of a user.
Developed recreatively with the potential goal of being used by the Fortress Faceoffs Tournament Org.

(ETF2L is the european competetive tf2 league. RGL is the NA equivalent.)
